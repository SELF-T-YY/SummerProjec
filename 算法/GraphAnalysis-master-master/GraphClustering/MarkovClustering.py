    MCL algorithm. 
    Unlike some other clustering techniques like K-means clustering, in MCL the
    number of clusters is not predetermined. The idea is to operate random
    walks through the graph.  While walking inside a cluster the probability of
    staying inside the same cluster is high. 
    
    Algorithm - steps:
        1) column normalize the matrix
        2) raise the matrix to the e-th power (simulates the random walk)
        3) raise each element to the r-th power and column normalize. It
            strengthens more likely currents while weakening the less likely
            (faster convergence).
        4) repeat steps 2 and 3 until we are in a steady state or max number of
            iterations T is reached
        5) interpret clusters (non-zero elements along rows)
    
    A possible future improvement could be the pruning of cells in case of huge
    graphs. It is similar to inflation, we set little matrix values directly to
    zero to speed up the process.
